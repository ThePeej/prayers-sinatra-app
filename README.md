## A Sinatra Portfolio Project for Flatiron School



For this assessment you'll be creating any sort of CRUD app. The app should be a custom app that is created to track something important to you. Whether that's your golf club collection, or a travel app. These types of apps are generally referred to as CRUD (Create Read Update Delete apps) or simple Content Management Systems.


## Instructions

5. Make sure to create a good README.md with a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code.
6. Make sure to check each box in your spec.md (replace the space between the square braces with an x) and explain next to each one how you've met the requirement *before* you submit your project.
7. Prepare a short video demo (narration helps!) describing how a user would interact with your working application.
8. Write a blog post about the project and process.
9. When done, submit your GitHub repo's url, a link to your video demo, and a link to your blog post in the corresponding text boxes in the right rail. Hit "I'm done" to wrap it up.

Unlike the rest of the curriculum, if you have any questions about your assessment or need help with it, please *donâ€™t* use the Ask New Question feature. Rather than working with Learn Experts, please reach out to your Learn Instructor responsible for this section instead

## If you're a Learn-Verified Premium student:

We'll send an email to you soon to schedule a pairing process. If you don't hear from us in 48 hours after submission, get in touch!

### Be Prepared to:

1. Confirm your application meets the requirements above. We'll go through your app and ask you to show us how it meets the requirements above. 5-10 mins.
2. Explain your code from execution point to exit point. We're making sure you wrote it and understand how it works. 10-15 mins.
3. Live coding, doing a refactoring exercise to make sure you're comfortable working with your code. 10-15 mins.

### What to expect from the pairing session

Project reviews are focused on preparing you for technical interviews. Treat project reviews as if they were technical interviews, in both attitude and technical presentation.
